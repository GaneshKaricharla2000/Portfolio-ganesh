            <blockquote><p class="aboutme-text1">"Ever since I was a little kid, software development has been my passion. 
                I still remember sitting in front of a computer, with many games loaded into it,
                making it follow my instructions (<i>Go Right,.. No no.. Go-left</i>)
                As I went through the C programming tutorial, it was almost magic, 
                being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted, 
                just by typing in these funny little symbols, limited only by my own imagination an
                d ingenuity. Throughout middle and high school, 
                I latched on to any ideas for projects I could get, moving from "Hello World" all the way to a 
                simple projects like Personal Password Manager and then a step high, I learned C, then C++, tearing through any books and video lectures 
                I could find on anything remotely related to software development. I was insatiable.</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p class="aboutme-text2">This passion carried me through my education in Computer Science and Engineering. 
                Here there were more resources available to me than I ever could have imagined as a kid
                I studied new languages, algorithms, compilers, higher mathematics, all with pretty much
                the same fascination that drove me as a kid. 
                And it was here that I learned truly how much there was yet to learn."
